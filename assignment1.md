1.Write about other Linux distributions not listed in this material.
2.What do you understand by open source?
 
Answer1: 
Ubuntu
Ubuntu is probably the most well-known Linux distribution. Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it has its own software repositories. Much of the software in these repositories is synced from Debian's repositories.

Fedora
Fedora is a project with a strong focus on free software -- you won't find an easy way to install proprietary graphics drivers here, although third-party repositories are available. Fedora is bleeding edge and contains the latest versions of software.

Mageia / Mandriva
Mageia is a fork of Mandriva Linux created in 2011. Mandriva -- known as Mandrake before that -- was once one of the great user-friendly Linux distributions.

Slackware Linux
Slackware is another institution. Founded in 1993, Slackware is the oldest Linux distribution that's still maintained and putting out new releases today.

Answer2:

Open source refers to software that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. It is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration. Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs.
